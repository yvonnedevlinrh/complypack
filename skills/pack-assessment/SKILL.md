# /comply:pack-assessment — Rego Policy Generation and Assessment

Generate Rego policies from Gemara Control Catalogs that enforce compliance requirements. Policies must be written to disk, validated against the target platform schema, and tested with sample inputs.

**Core principle:** Read control definitions from source → Generate platform-specific policy → Write to disk → Verify it works.

## Quick Reference

| Step | Action | Output |
| ---- | ------ | ------ |
| 1. Scope | Call `get_automation_triage`, filter to automated plans | Requirement list |
| 2. Read control | Get definition from catalog (MCP) | Control text, ID, title |
| 3. Get parameters | Extract assessment requirements | Thresholds, values |
| 4. Read schema | Get platform schema (MCP) | Platform schema |
| 5. Choose format | Select evaluator output convention | Policy structure |
| 6. Generate policy | Write Rego against schema contract | .rego file |
| 7. Write to disk | Save to `policy/` | File on disk |
| 8. Generate provider mapping | Create provider-specific mapping file | `complytime-mapping.json` (OPA) or `complytime-ampel-policy.json` (Ampel) |
| 9. Validate | Contract check then test | Pass/fail results |

## Step 1: Scope — Filter to Automated Requirements

Call `get_automation_triage` with the policy name to get the automation split:

1. The tool returns `automated` and `manual` lists with requirement IDs, evaluation methods, and executor details
2. Generate policies only for requirements in the `automated` list
3. List `manual` requirements for the user — these need human review

If no policy is loaded in the MCP server, proceed with all requested requirements.

## Steps 2-5: Read and Prepare

**DO NOT generate from general knowledge.** Always read the actual control text from MCP.

1. **Read control** — get the definition from the catalog via MCP (`complypack://catalog/*`)
2. **Get parameters** — call `get_assessment_requirements` to extract thresholds and accepted values
3. **Read schema** — get the platform schema via MCP (`complypack://schema/*`)
4. **Choose format** — select evaluator output convention (e.g., OPA `deny` rules for Conftest)

## Step 6: Generate Policy — Reusability Rules

Write policies against the platform schema contract, not sample inputs:

- **Write `input.*` paths from the schema.** Read `complypack://schema/*` and use the paths it defines. Do NOT reverse-engineer paths from sample manifests in `targets/`.
- **No hardcoded values from test data.** Do not embed names, image refs, step names, or other values from sample inputs. Use parameter values from `get_assessment_requirements` for thresholds and accepted values.
- **One file per assessment requirement.** Name the file after the requirement (e.g., `run_as_nonroot.rego`).
- **Identify the subject in denial messages.** Use fields from the schema that identify the resource being checked (e.g., `input.metadata.name` for Kubernetes, `input.name` for CI jobs). Do not hardcode expected values in messages.

## Step 7: Write to Disk

Save to `policy/` directory.

## Step 8: Generate Provider-Specific Mapping File

After writing policy files to disk, generate the mapping file that links assessment plan requirement IDs to their generated policy files. The file format depends on the configured `evaluator-id` in `complypack.yaml`. This file is bundled with the policy files when published as a ComplyPack OCI artifact.

### OPA provider (`evaluator-id: opa`) — `complytime-mapping.json`

Maps Gemara Policy assessment plan requirement IDs to the Rego package namespaces of the generated checks. The opa-provider uses this file at scan time to match incoming assessment configurations to the correct Rego policies.

**Build the mapping from existing rego files.** Before generating, scan the policy output directory (e.g., `policy/`) for `.rego` files and read the `package` declaration from each one. Use these actual package namespaces as the `id` values — do not invent or assume namespaces.

1. List all `.rego` files in the policy directory
2. For each file, extract the `package` declaration (e.g., `package kubernetes.tls_version`)
3. Match each package namespace to its corresponding `requirement-id` from the Policy's `adherence.assessment-plans`
4. Write the mapping file

```json
{
  "version": "1",
  "mappings": [
    {
      "id": "kubernetes.tls_version",
      "requirement_id": "CTL-TLS-001-AR1"
    },
    {
      "id": "kubernetes.tls_ciphers",
      "requirement_id": "CTL-TLS-001-AR2"
    }
  ]
}
```

- `id` — the Rego `package` namespace declared in the `.rego` file (e.g., `package kubernetes.tls_version` → `"kubernetes.tls_version"`)
- `requirement_id` — the Gemara requirement-id from `adherence.assessment-plans[].requirement-id` in the Policy
- One entry per rego file; no duplicates in either field
- Write to `complytime-mapping.json` in the policy output directory alongside the `.rego` files

### Ampel provider (`evaluator-id: ampel`) — granular policy files + `complytime-ampel-policy.json`

Generate one JSON file per assessment requirement (granular policy), then merge them into a single `complytime-ampel-policy.json` bundle.

**Granular policy file** (one per requirement, e.g., `require-pull-request.json`):

```json
{
  "id": "require-pull-request",
  "meta": {
    "description": "Validate branch protection settings require pull/merge requests",
    "controls": [
      {
        "framework": "repo-branch-protection",
        "class": "source-code",
        "id": "pull-request-enforcement"
      }
    ]
  },
  "tenets": [
    {
      "id": "01",
      "code": "<CEL expression>",
      "predicates": {
        "types": ["<attestation predicate type URI>"]
      },
      "assessment": {
        "message": "Direct pushes are disabled. Pull/Merge requests required."
      },
      "error": {
        "message": "Direct pushes are enabled so Pull/Merge requests are not required.",
        "guidance": "Create a branch ruleset and enable 'Restrict updates'."
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

**Merged bundle** (`complytime-ampel-policy.json`):

```json
{
  "id": "complytime-ampel-policy",
  "meta": {
    "frameworks": [
      { "id": "ComplyTime-AMPEL-Policy", "name": "ComplyTime AMPEL Policy" }
    ]
  },
  "policies": [ /* all granular policies merged here */ ]
}
```

- `id` in each granular policy is the policy's semantic identity, matched against the Gemara requirement-id at scan time
- `tenets[].code` contains CEL expressions evaluated against attestation predicates
- `tenets[].predicates.types` lists the attestation predicate type URIs the tenet evaluates
- Write granular files to the policy output directory, then merge into `complytime-ampel-policy.json`

## Step 9: Validate — Contract Check First

1. Run `validate_policy` — confirm zero contract violations against the platform schema
2. If contract violations: fix the `input.*` paths to match the schema. The schema is the source of truth, not test data.
3. Run `test_policy` — confirm policy logic works with sample inputs

## Safety

**DO NOT generate from general knowledge.** Always read the actual control text from MCP.

## MCP Resources and Tools

- `complypack://catalog/*` — Control Catalogs, Guidance Catalogs, Policies
- `complypack://schema/*` — Platform schemas
- `complypack://evaluator` — Available evaluators
- `get_automation_triage` — Classify assessment plans as Automated or Manual with executor details
- `get_assessment_requirements` — Extract assessment requirements with parameters
- `validate_policy` — Validate policy syntax and contract compliance
- `test_policy` — Run policy tests against sample data

## Red Flags - STOP AND FIX IF THERE ARE ISSUES

- [ ] Does every `input.*` reference exist in the platform schema?
- [ ] Are there hardcoded values from sample inputs that should be parameters?
- [ ] Did you run `validate_policy` before `test_policy`?
- [ ] Is each `.rego` file scoped to a single assessment requirement?
- [ ] Did you read control text from MCP, not from general knowledge?
- [ ] Did you call `get_automation_triage` to determine which plans are automated?
- [ ] Did you generate the provider-specific mapping file (`complytime-mapping.json` for OPA, `complytime-ampel-policy.json` for Ampel)?
